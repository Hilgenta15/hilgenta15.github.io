			<h1>About</h1>
				<div class="about-paragraph">
					<p>
					I've always had a passion for technology and electronics. For a long time, I never knew how to express this in a way I was comfortable. I could comprehend code, but I didn't want to be a developer. I enjoyed writing, but I still wanted to be technical. I never realized there was actually a profession that connected the two so perfectly.
					</p>  
					<p>
					My career history is filled with examples of some work involving IT, or Healthcare IT. This work satisfied me for a while, but over time, I felt something was missing. When I became proficient at the position I was in, I loved being able to confidently share my knowledge to others that were learning similar things that I had picked up. I won't lie; I didn't always have the immediate answers to every question. But, I was always willing to listen to an engineer or developer take the time to explain it so that it made sense to me. This was my favorite part&#8212;engineers love to use technical jargon. This might be great for colleagues or other users at their expertise, but what if you needed to explain this to a novice? It's like solving an extended word puzzle. What is the best way to break this jargon down into layman's terms? How can I write and design this document to ensure the audience doesn't get intimidated or confused by the information, but complex enough that they feel like it isn't wasting time? Cases like these ultimately made me realize that I could get much more of this through the career path of Technical Writing. I was elated to realize that I didn't need to separate technical aptitude, instruction, and use of language into their own worlds. This is what culminated in me making the effort to learn HTML and CSS to develop this site from scratch, and to showcase my willingness to always continue learning about new code or other logic from any other product asked from me in the future.
